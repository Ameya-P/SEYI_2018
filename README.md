## About This Year's Internship
2018 is the sixth year that I've run the Stanfor Earth Young Investigators: Biodiversity Internship (the Internship formerly known as History of Life). The main foci of the previous five summers were a large body size data colleciton effort and small group, intern-driven research projects. This year I'm trying something completely different. In 2018 we are focuing primarially on data analysis, data vizualizations, and scientific writing: we will collectivley wirte a paper on the physiological and ecological drivers of body size evolution in Phanerozoic marine animals.

## Scientific Objectives
* Understand why animals have gotten bigger over time
* Learn why some groups follow the trend and others do not
* Determine if there are physiological, ecological, or evolutionary drivers to increasing size

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the program, interns should be able toâ€¦

* critically read a scientific paper.
* outline and write a scientific paper.
* formulate and test a paleontological hypothesis.
* conduct basic statistical analyses.
* write R code to conduct analyses and generate figures.
* discuss the basic biology of major marine invertebrate fossils.

## <a name="lab-exercises"></a>'Lab' Exercises
These exercises are meant to help you gain a better understanding of geological time; the diversity and biology of fossil organisms; and the scienctific practices of geologists and paleobiologists.

## <a name="r-exercises"></a>R Exercises (*in progress*)
These R exercises were developed by [Andrew Zaffos](https://github.com/aazaff) for the UW-Madison Paleobiology Course. I modified them for SEYI. Start your introduction to R [here](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/README.md)

## <a name="special-presentations"></a>Special Presentations (*in progress & subject to change*)
This summer we will have several special presentations by Stanford (and maybe other) reserchers. The Goal of these presentations is to indtorduce you to the breadth of evolutinary, ecological, and geolgogical reserach that takes place at Stanford. **This schedule is subject to change**.

Date | Speaker | Topic
---- | --------| -----
17 July 2018 AM | Don Lowe, Geolgoical Sci. | Precambrian sedimentary geology & geobiology
24 July 2018 PM | Bridget Algee-Hewitt, Biology | Human Biology
02 August 2018 AM | Erik Sperling & Aodhan Butler, Geolgoical Sci. | Cambrian Paleobiology

## <a name="reading-discussion"></a>Reading & Discussion (*subject to change*)
We will read a combination of peer-reviewed scientific articles as well a book on body size that is geared towards a more genearl audience. The objectives of reading and discussing scientific articles and books are to teach you how to read a scientific paper, provide general background on body-size reserach, and give you an idea of analytical methods you may want to use in your own research. The book we are going to read is *Why Size Matters* by John Bonner.
