## <a name="lab-exercises"></a>'Lab' Exercises
These exercises are meant to help you gain a better understanding of geological time; the diversity and biology of fossil organisms; and the scienctific practices of geologists and paleobiologists.

## <a name="r-exercises"></a>R Exercises (*in progress*)
These R exercises were developed by [Andrew Zaffos](https://github.com/aazaff) for the UW-Madison Paleobiology Course. I modified them for SEYI. Start your introduction to R [here](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/README.md)

Date | Exercise
---- | -----
25 June 2018 AM | [Beginning R](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/beginnerConcepts.md) & [Intermediate R](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/intermediateConcepts.md)
26 June 2018 AM | [Advanced R](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/advancedConcepts.md) & [Expert R](https://github.com/naheim/startLearn.R/blob/master/expertConcepts.md)
26 June 2018 PM | Intro to PBDB

## <a name="special-presentations"></a>Special Presentations (*in progress & subject to change*)
This summer we will have several special presentations by Stanford (and maybe other) reserchers. The Goal of these presentations is to indtorduce you to the breadth of evolutinary, ecological, and geolgogical reserach that takes place at Stanford. **This schedule is subject to change**.

Date | Speaker | Topic
---- | --------| -----
17 July 2018 AM | Don Lowe, Geolgoical Sci. | Precambrian sedimentary geology & geobiology
24 July 2018 PM | Bridget Algee-Hewitt, Biology | Human Biology
02 August 2018 AM | Erik Sperling & Aodhan Butler, Geolgoical Sci. | Cambrian Paleobiology

## <a name="reading-discussion"></a>Reading & Discussion (*subject to change*)
We will read a combination of peer-reviewed scientific articles as well a book on body size that is geared towards a more genearl audience. The objectives of reading and discussing scientific articles and books are to teach you how to read a scientific paper, provide general background on body-size reserach, and give you an idea of analytical methods you may want to use in your own research. The book we are going to read is *Why Size Matters* by John Bonner.
